It is useful for your team to plan and ensure team members clearly understand what tickets need to be completed and when.

If a team member starts working on a ticket that is not the top priority, it can cause confusion or delays in the overall project plan. After finishing tickets in the current sprint and backlog, your team can pull relatively urgent tickets from this section and move them into the current sprint.'
